Before & After

The top image is the theme before I did any changes to it, the bottom image is the final website with all the changes we made. We changed the colour scheme a few times before actually choosing one and we went through several images before picking one for the splash screen.

## CSS Code
So after choosing a colour scheme and realising we wanted to change things we added a bit of CSS code to move and change things accordingly.

#menu_wrap {
	background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.75);
}

#header_inner h1.sitename_logo, #header_inner #logo {
	width:400px;
}

#header_inner h2, #header_inner h1.sitename_logo a {
	font-size:20px;
}

#menu_wrap a {
    color: white;
}

a {
    color: #a8d34a;
}

#search_toggle{
	display : none
}
